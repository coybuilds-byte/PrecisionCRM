# Copilot / AI Agent Instructions

Purpose: help AI agents understand repository structure, developer workflows,
and project-specific patterns so suggestions, patches, and PRs are accurate.

Key points (quick):
- **Repo state:** No discoverable Python/agent docs were found. Agents must
  look for common entry points (`pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`,
  `setup.py`, `src/`, `app.py`, `main.py`, `tests/`) and confirm with the
  user when uncertain.
- **Environment:** Prefer creating an isolated venv and installing
  dependencies from `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` before running
  scripts or tests.

How to get the "big picture"
- Open `pyproject.toml` / `setup.cfg` / `setup.py` to find packaging and
  dependency information.
- Inspect `src/` or top-level modules for the main application entrypoint(s).
- Check `tests/` and `conftest.py` to learn fixtures and application patterns.
- If `docker/` or `Dockerfile` exists, read it to understand runtime services.

Developer workflows (checks an agent should run or suggest):
- Setup (PowerShell):
  ```powershell
  python -m venv .venv
  .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
  if (Test-Path requirements.txt) { pip install -r requirements.txt }
  else { pip install -e . }
  ```
- Run tests (if `pytest` present): `pytest -q` (or `python -m pytest -q`).
- Run linters: check for `pyproject.toml` or `requirements.txt` for tools
  like `ruff`, `flake8`, or `black`. Example: `ruff .` then `black --check .`.
- Run the app: locate `if __name__ == '__main__'` blocks or `src/<pkg>/__main__.py`.

Project Overview (discovered in provided ZIP)
- **Monorepo layout:** The project contains a full-stack app under
  `imported_recruitflow/RecruitFlow/RecruitFlow` with a TypeScript/Node
  backend and client plus a Python FastAPI microservice in
  `python-services`.
- **Node/TS backend:** `package.json` lives at the root of that folder and
  provides `dev` (development), `build`, and `start` scripts. In PowerShell,
  prefer setting the env var separately before running the script:
  ```powershell
  cd imported_recruitflow/RecruitFlow/RecruitFlow
  npm install
  $env:NODE_ENV = 'development'
  npx tsx server/index.ts
  # or use: npm run dev (may require a POSIX shell for inline ENV assignment)
  ```
- **Python microservice (Resume Parser):** located at
  `python-services/resume_parser`. Dependencies are in
  `python-services/requirements.txt` and a helper `start_service.py` starts
  the FastAPI app on port `8001`.
  ```powershell
  cd imported_recruitflow/RecruitFlow/RecruitFlow/python-services
  python -m venv .venv
  .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  python start_service.py
  # or: cd resume_parser; python -m uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8001
  ```
- **Integration points:** The Node server file `server/start-python-service.ts`
  will spawn the Python service in development (`python python-services/start_service.py`).
  Ensure `python` is on PATH when running the Node dev server.
- **Tests:** Python unit tests live in `python-services/tests` and run with
  `python -m pytest tests/test_resume_parser.py -v` from `python-services`.


Project-specific conventions (how suggestions should conform):
- Type hints: prefer adding or preserving type annotations when touching public
  functions (if the project already uses them).
- Tests-first: if adding or changing behavior, include or update tests in
  `tests/` following existing test naming patterns (e.g., `test_*.py`).
- Logging: use the project logger if present (search for `logging.getLogger(`).
- Small, focused PRs: prefer incremental changes with a clear commit message
  describing the problem and the fix.

Integration points & CI
- Search for `.github/workflows/` to discover GitHub Actions. Agents should
  update workflow YAML only when necessary and compatible with existing jobs.
- If a `docker-compose.yml` exists, the project may rely on local services
  (databases, caches). Use `docker compose up` to reproduce integration tests.

When you can't find files referenced above
- Ask the user which files are the app entrypoints and where tests live.
- Provide a short diff/PR that adds a `README.md` or `pyproject.toml` snippet
  documenting how to run the project, and request confirmation.

Examples to look for when making edits (replace these placeholders with real
paths from this repo when available):
- Main package: `src/<package_name>/` or top-level `<package_name>/`
- Entrypoint: `src/<package_name>/cli.py` or `app.py` with `if __name__ == '__main__'`
- Tests: `tests/test_example.py`, fixtures in `tests/conftest.py`

Merge guidance when an existing `.github/copilot-instructions.md` exists:
- Preserve any repository-specific commands and examples.
- Add new guidance only after confirming it doesn't duplicate or contradict
  existing instructions.

If you (maintainer) want a tighter, tailored instruction set
- Share the main package path, test command, and any special dev scripts
  (`Makefile`, `scripts/`, `docker/`). With those paths I will update this
  document to include concrete file examples and exact commands.

File-level edit guidance (where to make common changes)
- **Auth & routes:** Modify authentication logic in `server/auth.ts` and
  route wiring in `server/auth-routes.ts` and `server/routes.ts`. Typical
  changes include adding middleware, updating session handling, or
  registering new API endpoints.
- **Start/Dev flow:** The server entry is `server/index.ts`. In development
  it sets `NODE_ENV` and conditionally starts Vite and the Python service.
  Prefer running `npx tsx server/index.ts` from the project root when debugging
  on Windows.
- **Python service:** The resume parser lives under
  `python-services/resume_parser`. Edit FastAPI handlers in
  `python-services/resume_parser/main.py` and parsing logic in
  `python-services/resume_parser/contact_mapper.py`.
- **Inter-process integration:** `server/start-python-service.ts` spawns the
  Python helper `python-services/start_service.py` in development. When
  changing the Python service port or entrypoint, update both files.
- **Storage & external APIs:** Object storage and DB integrations are in
  `server/objectStorage.ts` and `server/db.ts`. Update credentials via env
  vars; avoid committing secrets.
- **Tests:** Node/TS tests are not included in the extracted folder, but
  Python tests live in `python-services/tests/test_resume_parser.py` and
  run with `pytest` from `python-services`.

Practical editing examples
- Add a new API route: edit `server/routes.ts` to `app.use('/api/your', yourRouter)`
- Change resume-parser health path: edit `python-services/resume_parser/main.py`
  to expose any additional debug endpoints.
- Update dev start behavior on Windows: prefer `powershell` friendly
  env setting (`$env:NODE_ENV = 'development'`) before running `npx tsx`.

Windows notes
- Some `package.json` scripts use POSIX env assignments (`NODE_ENV=...`) —
  these don't work in PowerShell. Use `$env:NODE_ENV = 'development'` or run
  scripts via Git Bash/WSL.
