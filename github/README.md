Quick start

- Open `desktop-tutorial.code-workspace` in VS Code.
- Run the workspace setup script (PowerShell):

```powershell
./scripts/setup.ps1

What the setup script does
- Attempts to create a Python virtual environment in `.venv` if `python` or `py` is available.
- Prints next steps for activating the environment and recommended extensions.
